README
=====

The graduation project contains two main periodical part.

1. BIF algorithm realization.

This include the design of structure and code using C++ and MATLAB. This part is mainly done by reading the paper about BIF and then write the code according to the equations and descriptions.


2. Building System 

This means build the system from scratch. Even though I could use some external dll or library, I still have to integrate the BIF algorithm, UI, face recognition, video capturing and other components to make it work.



---------------------------------------
About the functions of system:
1. Estimate human age according to static human picture which contains faces(multiple faces is not supported well currently)
2. Estimate human age according to the camera connected to the PC, which could dynamically estimate the age.
3. Estimate the gender as well when estimate the age

This system is my final presentation of graduation project.



Responsibility
=========

My responsibility of this project is to build the system to estimate human age based on static picture or dynamically captured video. I used BIF algorithm for age estimation, and then use other components like SVM, face recognition, noise deduction for pre-operation. I also used MFC to design the UI and write all codes to make all these components work well.



Thanks!
