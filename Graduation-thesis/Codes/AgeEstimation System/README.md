README
=====

This system is my final presentation of graduation project. The above BIF algorithm is just a part of this system and it lays the foundation of the estimation part. As this system contains many components from authorized universities and research institution, the complete code could not be open source.

This folder only upload the essential release program for preview and use. Besides, as it's a long time since I last developed the program, I don't maintain the code any more. There is no installation and other portable version.


Responsibility
=========

My responsibility of this project is to build the system to estimate human age based on static picture or dynamically captured video. I used BIF algorithm for age estimation, and then use other components like SVM, face recognition, noise deduction for pre-operation. I also used MFC to design the UI and write all codes to make all these components work well.



Thanks!
